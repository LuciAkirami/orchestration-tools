# ------------------------- Running Tasks Concurrently -------------------------------
# Tasks enable concurrent execution, allowing you to execute multiple tasks asynchronously.
# This concurrency can greatly enhance the efficiency and performance of your workflows.

# Now youâ€™re fetching the data you need from fetching_from_api(), but the requests happen sequentially.
# Tasks expose a submit method that changes the execution from sequential to concurrent.
# In this example, you also need to use the result method to unpack a list of return values:


@flow
def execute_tasks_concurrently():
    res = []
    for i in range(1, 10):
        # here instead of fetching_from_api(i), we do fetching_from_api.submit(i), which lets tasks run concurrently
        res.append(fetching_from_api.submit(i))

    # finally we need to call the .result() for each task to obtain the values returned from that task
    res = [individual_result.result() for individual_result in res]
    return res
